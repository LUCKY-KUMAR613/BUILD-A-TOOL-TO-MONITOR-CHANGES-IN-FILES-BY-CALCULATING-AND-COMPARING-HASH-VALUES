THIS PROJECT AIMS TO BUILD A SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE FILE MONITORING TOOL USING PYTHON THAT CAN DETECT CHANGES IN FILE CONTENTS BY CALCULATING AND COMPARING THEIR HASH VALUES. FILE MONITORING IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE IN MANY SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS LIKE CYBERSECURITY, DATA BACKUP, COMPLIANCE AUDITING, AND SYSTEM INTEGRITY CHECKING. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A BASIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN A USER-FRIENDLY AND UNDERSTANDABLE WAY.

AT ITS CORE, THIS TOOL WORKS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CREATING A DIGITAL "FINGERPRINT" OF A FILE, KNOWN AS A HASH. A HASH VALUE IS A FIXED-LENGTH STRING OF CHARACTERS THAT IS GENERATED FROM THE CONTENT OF A FILE USING A HASH FUNCTION. EVEN A SMALL CHANGE IN THE FILE WILL RESULT IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HASH VALUE. THIS MAKES HASHING AN EXCELLENT WAY TO DETECT CHANGES OR TAMPERING IN FILES.

THE TOOL WORKS IN TWO MAIN MODES:

STORE MODE

CHECK MODE

IN STORE MODE, THE USER RUNS THE TOOL TO CALCULATE AND SAVE THE HASH VALUE OF A SPECIFIC FILE. THIS VALUE IS STORED IN A LOCAL DATABASE OR A JSON FILE, MAPPED WITH THE FILE NAME. THIS MODE IS USED FOR INITIAL REGISTRATION OF A FILE INTO THE MONITORING SYSTEM.

IN CHECK MODE, THE USER RUNS THE TOOL AGAIN TO RE-CALCULATE THE HASH OF THE SAME FILE AND COMPARE IT TO THE PREVIOUSLY STORED HASH. IF THE HASHES MATCH, IT MEANS THE FILE IS UNCHANGED. IF THE HASHES DO NOT MATCH, IT INDICATES THAT THE FILE HAS BEEN MODIFIED, EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR ACCIDENTALLY.

THE TOOL UTILIZES PYTHON'S BUILT-IN HASHLIB MODULE TO GENERATE SHA-256 HASHES OF FILE CONTENTS. THE FILE IS READ IN BINARY MODE TO ENSURE ACCURATE HASHING, REGARDLESS OF THE FILE TYPE OR ENCODING. THE PROJECT USES STANDARD PYTHON LIBRARIES TO READ, WRITE, AND MANAGE THE HASH VALUES.

THIS TOOL CAN BE EXTENDED TO MONITOR MULTIPLE FILES BY USING A DICTIONARY TO MAP FILENAMES TO HASHES. IT CAN ALSO BE IMPROVED BY ADDING LOGGING, TIMESTAMPS, EMAIL ALERTS, OR EVEN A SIMPLE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI).

FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT, FILE INTEGRITY MONITORING IS CRITICAL. FOR EXAMPLE, IN AN ORGANIZATION, SYSTEM FILES OR CONFIG FILES CAN BE MONITORED TO DETECT UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES. SIMILARLY, IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, IT CAN HELP VERIFY THAT IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ACCIDENTALLY ALTERED.

THE TOOL HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO BE SIMPLE, CLEAR, AND EASY TO USE FOR STUDENTS AND BEGINNERS LEARNING ABOUT FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS, HASH FUNCTIONS, AND BASIC SECURITY MECHANISMS. ALL FILE PATHS, COMMAND-LINE INPUTS, AND OUTPUTS ARE HANDLED IN A USER-FRIENDLY FORMAT WITH CLEAR MESSAGES.

IN CONCLUSION, THIS TASK DEMONSTRATES THE USEFULNESS OF HASH FUNCTIONS IN MONITORING FILE INTEGRITY. BY STORING AND COMPARING HASH VALUES, USERS CAN BE IMMEDIATELY ALERTED TO CHANGES IN THEIR FILES. THIS APPROACH IS COMMONLY USED IN REAL-WORLD ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS, VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND AUDIT TOOLS. THIS PROJECT HELPS BUILD A STRONG FOUNDATION IN CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES AND ENHANCES ONEâ€™S UNDERSTANDING OF SYSTEM PROTECTION MECHANISMS.
